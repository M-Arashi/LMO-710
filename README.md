# Linear Models (LMO)

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Linear Models** repository! This repository serves as a resource for learning the course linear models 1 (LMO701), covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. 
Whether you are a student, researcher, or professional, this course will help you develop a strong foundation in linear modeling techniques.

## Recommended Books
For a deeper understanding of linear models, we recommend the following books:

1. **"Linear Models" by S. R. Searle**  
   [Available here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118491782) - This book provides an in-depth theoretical treatment of linear models.
   
2. **"Linear Models with R" by Julian J. Faraway**
    [Available here](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/LMR/) -  This book provides a practical introduction to linear models using R, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced statisticians.
